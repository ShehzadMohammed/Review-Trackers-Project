## Kubernetes Deployment for APP

This directory simply contains thee manifest files for python server app. 

## Description 

All objects are defined to 'default' namespace. The minimum Kubernetes needed. Originally started with Helm to create end to end observability with Prometheus and Grafana charts + turn this app into a chart template as well. Time does not allow for a huge project such as that.
