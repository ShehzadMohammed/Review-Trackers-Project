# Review-Trackers-Project

### Description
Trunk-Based Development in a MonoRepo thus so many testing commits since this is a rushed one-day project. Essentially, we have four workflows ~
- Docker-workflow: Builds and pushes docker file to a public dockerhub account
- Terraform-kube-workflow: Initializes terraform creating AKS cluster then creates Kubernetes deployment and service. 
- Continuous-Deployment: Continuously applies terraform code 
- Terraform-Destroy: Only on manual trigger kills the environment 

###### `^^ P.s. Realized there was python file given after writing a python file :) ~ and decided not to use modules like Flask or Django to make it more difficult for myself  ^^`
